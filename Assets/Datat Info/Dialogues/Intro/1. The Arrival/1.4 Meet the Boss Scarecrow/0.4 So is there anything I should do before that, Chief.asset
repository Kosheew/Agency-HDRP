  _text: Not "SHOULD", but "COULD". Our interrogation officer, Ramirez, wants to
    have a word with you. Besides, the gun range is now reopened under my orders.
    It is still getting renovated, but it is usable enough for you to get your skills
    in check.   You would also get a taste of our new training AI shells there. Dismissed.
